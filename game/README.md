### DigNut

- Game Loop

- Tracking Player Position

- Tracking Time

##### Game Play Instructions

The goal of the game is to "dig" as many nuts as possible in the time limit.  To "dig", you must be <strong>in
front of</strong> the nut (the "N" characters).  As you move, your direction is tracked.  e.g. moving right makes you face right, left faces left, etc.  If the nut is in the next space in the direction the player is facing, digging will pick up the nut and spawn a new one in a new location.
