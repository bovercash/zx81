# ZX81

Collection of ZX81 Test Programs

Programs were written with help from many sources, most notably the mctemplate written by Thunor.  See below for links to resources.
 
All programs are free to use and distribute; I hope they are helpful as learning aids.


##### Build Instructions

1.  Files are built with Pasmo to generate `p` files.

```bash
pasmo -v -1 file.asm file.p
```

2.  Files are loaded into a ZX81 Emulator such as EightyOne.

3.  Files can be run on real hardware if loaded using a tape drive emulator.
